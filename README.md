Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is my hackathon project from my 1st ever hackathon. That i build with my team in the Mumbai hacks. The theme of the hackathon was Gen AI.

Basically What we Picked the SAAS part. In which we slected the Inventory prediction.

Since we participated in this hackathon in our 1st semester we had very little knowledege. 

We tried Build a project where you can upload the past sales of the shop and it will predict the future trends based on the given CSV file.
To make this we did Research from the internet how to build it and make it work. We found we need to train a AI model using a existing dataset.
So we took a live and cleaned dataset of 1000 sales order of a computer store for the year 2023 from kaggel and started training it with the help of youtube videos, reddit, chat gpt etc. 
We somehow got the output but it was of no use then. We also didn't knew how to connect all of this. So the project that we made is 20-25% completed. Due to lack of knowledege we couldn't finish it.

Once i get enough knowledege to make it in the 3-4 semester i will upload the full working model of this project.

Thank You. ðŸ«¡
